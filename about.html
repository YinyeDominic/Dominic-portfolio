              I'm Dominic Yinye, a computer engineering student passionate about technology and its impact on society. Currently in my second year of studies, I'm enthusiastic about exploring various aspects of computer engineering, from hardware to software development.My love for computing has moved me to be come a fully functional web developer over the past decade.
My academic focus lies in energy and natural resources, where I aim to leverage technology to address sustainability challenges. I believe in the power of innovation and collaboration to create positive change in the world.
Outside of my studies, I'm deeply involved in web development, where I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code. I have experience working on projects ranging from renewable energy management systems to smart water management solutions.
As a lifelong learner, I'm always seeking new opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge. Whether it's coding, data analysis, or project management, I'm eager to tackle new challenges and make a meaningful impact.
